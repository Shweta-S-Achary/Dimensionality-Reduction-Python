# Dimensionality-Reduction-Python

Dimensionality reduction is a process where we reduce the number of features, thus reducing the cost for analyzing the data. The data used in this project is a synthetic data of plant genetics. Here, we select 15 causal features from a total of 29,623 features using Pearson's Correlation. After feature selection, we perform classification on this new dataset using machine learning packages by implementing SVM, Gaussian  Na√Øve Bayes, Logistic Regression and Nearest Centroid techniques to compare the accuracy of predictions given by this new dataset.
